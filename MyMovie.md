My favorite movie is Spider-Man: No Way Home. This is my favorite movie because Spider-Man is my favorite superhero, and Tom Holland is my favorite spiderman, and this is the best movie out of the three that Tom Holland currently has. This movie has an engaging plot, and it is super cool how the movie brings in Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and each of their villains. Overall, I just really enjoy this movie and could watch it over and over again.
